		<description><![CDATA[<p>An air quality index (AQI) is a number used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become. Today, there is no standardized approach to providing air quality information globally, meaning AQIs are usually different from country to country. BreezoMeter has created a new uniform index: the BreezoMeter Air Quality Index (BAQI). &#8230; <a href="https://breezometer.com/faqs/air-quality-index-mean/" class="read-more">Read more</a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Local AQI is the air quality index of the location that was searched. Local AQIs use many different scales, and can range from 0-10, -100 to 400, and so forth. For some AQIs, the higher number represent better air quality, and for some it signifies worse.
